** writing forward model

*** q: are primitives learned?
yes, see section 2.3.1 of supplement

*** q: how many control points are there really?
five (see last sentence of caption for figure s2)

*** q: is the stroke starting location L redundant with the first control point of a substroke?

remark: the spline doesn't necessarily pass through any of the control points:

*** unanswered questions

what's the deal with J for the independent relation? it doesn't seem stochastic (upper right of fig s2)

fig s2 bottom right: top primitives are very similar.. do clustering to reduce redundancy?

control points are sampled twice: once for types and once for tokens
